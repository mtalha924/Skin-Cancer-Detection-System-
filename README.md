# Skin Cancer Detection Using VGG16

This project focuses on classifying skin cancer images as either **Benign** or **Malignant** using a deep learning model based on the **VGG16** architecture. Below is the project roadmap outlining the key steps and processes involved.

## Project Roadmap

### 1. Load and Preprocess Data
- **Objective**: Load the dataset and preprocess it for training and evaluation.
- **Steps**:
  - Organize the dataset into `train` and `test` directories.
  - Use `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and preprocessing.
  - Split the training data into training and validation sets (80% training, 20% validation).
  - Rescale images to a size of `224x224` pixels (input size for VGG16).
  - Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve generalization.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Steps**:
  - Check the distribution of classes (Benign vs. Malignant) to identify class imbalance.
  - Visualize sample images from each class.
  - Compute basic statistics such as the number of images in the training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Applying VGG16 Model for Transfer Learning
- **Objective**: Build and fine-tune a VGG16-based model for skin cancer classification.
- **Steps**:
  - Load the VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet, excluding the top layers.
  - Freeze the first 15 layers of VGG16 to retain learned features.
  - Add custom layers on top of VGG16:
    - Flatten layer to convert convolutional output to a 1D vector.
    - Dense layers with ReLU activation and L2 regularization.
    - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
    - Final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  - Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

### 4. Training the Model
- **Objective**: Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on the validation set.
- **Steps**:
  - Train the model for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32.
  - Use class weights to handle class imbalance.
  - Apply callbacks such as:
    - **Early Stopping**: Stop training if validation loss does not improve for 10 epochs.
    - **Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau**: Reduce learning rate if validation loss plateaus.
    - **Model Checkpoint**: Save the best model during training.
  - Monitor training and validation accuracy and loss.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
- **Objective**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
- **Steps**:
  - Compute test accuracy and loss.
  - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize true vs. predicted labels.
  - Generate a classification report with precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

### 6. Results
- **Objective**: Present the results of the model's performance.
- **Steps**:
  - Plot training and validation accuracy and loss curves.
  - Display the confusion matrix.
  - Print the classification report.
  - Save the trained model for future use.

### 7. Conclusion
- **Objective**: Summarize the findings and discuss potential improvements.
- **Steps**:
  - Highlight the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
  - Discuss limitations of the current approach.
  - Suggest future work, such as:
    - Using a larger and more diverse dataset.
    - Experimenting with other architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
    - Deploying the model in a real-world application.
